FAQ
---

Q: What system is this script for?
A: 
It is for ApolloOS (tested on R9.2). No idea, if it works on other systems
and with other network stacks than AROSTCP.

Q1: What does the script do?
A:

1) In the installation (first) part, the script does the following:
It extracts the following packages to the ram-disk:
- smb2fs.m68k-amigaos.lha
- filesysbox.m68k-amigaos.lha
The files have been included for convenience (the can be found on Aminet,
maybe check, if there are newer versions).
It then copies the following files:
- L:smb2-handler
- LIBS:filesysbox.library

2) In the configuration (second) part, the script does the following:
It asks for all necessary informations (ip,username,password,volume name,home).
It then creates the corresponding dosdriver (which can be found in DEVS:DOSDrivers)

Q2: How can I mount the share after that?
There are two possibilities:
1) Got to your SYS:Network drawer and click on the icon "activate_samba".
(You can drag the icon to another location if you prefer.)
2) Open a shell and type:
dir your-share-name:

Q3: Can I also activate SAMBA by clicking on the icon in DEVS:DOSDrivers or
by mounting it via the shell (mount your-share-name:)?
A:
As far as I understand, this is not necessary. The handler is automatically 
loaded (and "mounted") when ApolloOS starts up. To avoid any issues (due to
timing, because ApolloOS first needs to go online before the share can be 
activated) the option ACTIVATE (both in the icon as in the script) has been 
disabled. (It can then simply be activated like described in Q2.)

Q4: Any known issues?
When using it in ApolloOS and under the Workbench, it is not possible to open
any drawer by clicking on the icon (probably a but either in the handler or in
Workbench). 
Use DOpus or the shell instead to copy the files.

Q5: Can it be used for multiple shares?
A:
Yes, just launch the configuration script for each share.
The activate_samba script in SYS:Network will only activate the last share,
but you can always activate the other share by typing cd share-name: in the
shell (or by accessing them directly from a program).
